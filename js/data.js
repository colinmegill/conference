		title: "Participatory Democracy",
		description: "How does one participate in democracy and how to make participatory democracy possible have become issues of growing interest in recent years. At its inception, the g0v community had already discussed the related cases and set out to work on the platform development. However, more efforts are still needed in various areas in open data and infrastructures for the deepening of the democratization process. \n In this track, we have invited two international speakers to introduce Europe's Pirate Party and their online platform review experience. The panel will involve a direct dialogue between executive committee members who have promoted openness and participation in the cabinet with academics who have advocated deliberate democracy in the community"

This track features transnational citizen technology communities, the large-scale g0v-mobilized crowd OCR projects, as well as the two cornerstones of open content: 'Wikipedia' and 'OpenStreetMap', exploring the new driving forces of collaboration through practical case studies."
